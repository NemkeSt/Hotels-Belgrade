When you step into this cozy yard of Vračar, you will be surprised with the size of the flower garden and sophisticated style decoration of this restaurant. Garden is paved with bricks, tables are set under the trees which makes a colorful shade, and a place on the arc terrace will give you a nice view of the entire spacious garden. Now we ask you: Is there anything more beautiful than a light meal with a glass of wine in this cozy atmosphere? And if it gets cold, go inside and you will feel like home in Smokvica Molerova. Here you can dine next to a romantic fireplace with candles, or stay in one of the 8 unpretentiously decorated rooms located on the first floor. These specially designed guest house concept is what distinguishes Smokvica Vračar in Belgrade’s offer, because the only thing which separates you from the urban Belgrade are single, wooden stairs leading to the first floor. Sounds good, doesn’t it?",

        "description": "Smokvica u Gospodar Jovanovoj vam osim ukusa za pamćenje i ambijenta za uživanje pruža priliku da se nađete u legendarnoj istorijskoj kući. Za arhitekturu ovog istorijskog zdanja zaslužna je prva žena arhitekta u Srbiji, Jelisaveta Načić. Ova kuća knjižara Marka Markovića iz 1904. nedavno je proglašena za spomenik kulture, a sada je u njoj naša Smokvica, koja vam pruža priliku za uživanje u posebnoj gastronomskoj kulturi, kao i sveukupnoj kulturi življenja. Rad na preuređenju jednog od simbola gradskog života na Dunavskoj padini trajao je četiri godine, budući da se vodilo računa o tome da svaki važan arhitektonski detalj bude sačuvan. Drvo smokve koje se nalazilo u dvorištu presađeno je pet metara dalje, i svakodnevno je negovano sa velikom pažnjom. Za enterijer koji nas podseća na scenografiju nekog umetničkog filma zaslužna je Sanja Popov Radović čiji koncept i dizajn eneterijera odlikuje svaku od Smokvica. Prvi izbor koji će vam teško pasti je na kom od dva nivoa da provedete svoje vreme, budući da u svakom kutku ove Smokvice možete da zamislite sebe, dok ćete možda pomisliti i to da nikada nije toliko hladno da se ne nađete u bašti, koja izgleda kao umirujuća dnevna soba, samo bez krova. Pored neobičnih gastronomskih specijaliteta koji vam u svakoj Smokvici nude ne samo čulni užitak već i svojevrsno iskustvo ukusa, Smokvica u Jovanovoj ima i pizza peć na drva (hrast i bukva), a prave se od napuljskog brašna sa malo kvasca i bez šećera. Ukoliko osetite da vam se ne odlazi odavde, budite bez brige, Smokvica u Jovanovoj raspolaže sa 6 dvokrevetnih soba.",

        "address": "Kraljice Natalije 27",
        "city": "Belgrade",
        "description": "Hotel Prag is situated in the very heart of Belgrade. The Hotel was officially opened in 1929 and is one of the oldest hotels in Belgrade with its long tradition. The Hotel was built in several stages, in 1929, 1936 and in 1978. The beauty of the construction itself, characteristic for modern architecture of Europe of the XX century, classified it as one of the facilities (objects) under the protection of Institute for protection of cultural monuments of the city of Belgrade. The very first owner of the hotel was a Czech, and hence the name of the hotel, Prag!\n\nEven after it was completely reconstructed, Hotel Prag in Belgrade kept its traditional hospitality, warmth and cordiality, specific for this area. The spirit of old, Bohemian Belgrade, present in the Hotel Prag, will bring you back to the glorious epoch of our capital.\n\nSince the hotel is situated in the very centre of Belgrade, one can easily reach the most significant tourist attractions, monuments, institutions, nightspots and shopping centres by walking. \nThe hotel was built according to the project of the architect Mr. Djuro Borosic, in a formerly very well-known Commercial Street in the centre of Belgrade. It was exposed in both the first salon of architecture in 1929 and exhibition of Yugoslavian modern architecture in 1939, as a truly splendid deco style piece of art. Hotel Prag was being built in the period from May to November 1929, and it was officially opened in December 1929.\n\nInitially, there were two entrance doors in “Prag” – the main entrance from the Street Kraljica Natalija and the other one from Balkanska Street (on the angular façade), leading to the tavern. The main entrance is the only one predicted for reception of guests of the hotel and it leads directly to the lobby of the Hotel where the reception desk and the main stairway are to be found. Therefore, it is of immense importance that it is distinguished from other entrances by its construction. Thus, the Hotel’s main entrance and pillars on the stairway are constructed out of artificial marble, and the façade out of artificial stone. Later on, during 1936, the adaptation of the Hotel occurred on two occasions. At the beginning of the year, slight interior renovation was carried out and one meter attic upgrading as well, but, by the end of 1936, the extensive works on the building of the Hotel commenced. Extension of the Hotel from Balkans Street was performed and that is when the restaurant space was dislocated and extended and the third entrance was opened. Back then probably as it is the case today, this entrance led to business premises (workshop, laundry room, kitchen), which were completely separated from the Hotel’s public rooms.\n\nWhen the construction was completed, the Hotel consisted of 4 floors with seven rooms on each floor, from where magnificent view extended over Sremska plain, Topcer and Avala. During the Hotel’s expansion in 1936, six more rooms were added to each floor, and at the same time, the fifth floor and partly the mansard were built as well.\n\nAccording to technical documentation, Hotel “Prag” in Belgrade offered its guests accommodation solely in single rooms, which explained the fact that the object was situated in the core of the city and that its services were mostly designated for businessman. Shared toilets and one bathroom were constructed on each floor, which complied with standards of the hotel’s architecture at the time. Namely, except for the guests who stayed at the apartments, the luxury of having the private bathroom was not predicted for interwar hotels, only the number of shared sanitary facilities varied depending on the rank of the object itself. \n",
